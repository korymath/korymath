I am a Research Scientist with DeepMind and a Lab Scientist with the Creative Destruction Lab. I have a Ph.D. in Computing Science from the University of Alberta with the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute. My research focuses on understanding interaction between humans and machines, with a focus on conversational dialog systems and human-robot interfaces.

I am also an accomplished improvisational theatre performance artist with Rapid Fire Theatre. I like to fuse my interests by developing artificial intelligences to perform theatre alongside.
