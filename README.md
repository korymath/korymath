I am a Research Scientist with [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com/) and a Lab Scientist with the [Creative Destruction Lab](https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/). 

I have a Ph.D. in Computing Science from the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) with the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute](https://www.amii.ca/). 

My research focuses on understanding interaction between intelligent systems. 

I am currently focusing on  üßë‚Äçü¶≥-ü§ñ interfaces.

You might also know me as an improvisational theatre performance artist with [Rapid Fire Theatre](https://rapidfiretheatre.com/). 

I like to fuse my interests by developing artificial intelligences to perform theatre alongside.
